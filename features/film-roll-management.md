Every frame of film costs money and carries the weight of an unrepeatable moment. FilmMeter's film roll management system helps you make each frame count by providing a complete digital notebook for your analog photography workflow. From the moment you load a roll into your camera to the day you pick up developed negatives from the lab, FilmMeter tracks every detail so you can learn from your shooting patterns and never lose a record of your creative decisions.

### Creating and Managing Film Rolls

Start a new roll by selecting your film format (135 or [120 medium format](/features/medium-format/)), choosing a film stock from the [film stocks database](/film-stocks/), and optionally assigning a camera preset. FilmMeter automatically sets the correct frame count based on your format -- 24 or 36 exposures for 135 film, and the appropriate count for your medium format back (16 frames for 6x4.5, 12 for 6x6, 10 for 6x7, 8 for 6x9). A Rollei and Leica-inspired mechanical frame counter provides a tactile visual reference as you advance through the roll.

### Shot-by-Shot Recording

Each exposure can be recorded with comprehensive metadata:

- **Exposure settings**: Aperture, shutter speed, and ISO as metered by FilmMeter's [precision light meter](/features/light-metering/)
- **Focal length**: The lens focal length used for each shot
- **Location data**: GPS coordinates and address when location services are enabled
- **Photo attachment**: Capture a reference photo from the iPhone camera alongside your metered reading
- **Notes**: Free-text field for scene descriptions, lighting conditions, filter usage, or push/pull processing intentions
- **Scene detection data**: The [AI scene detection](/features/scene-detection/) result and any applied EV compensation

### Roll Status Workflow

Film rolls progress through a clear status workflow that mirrors the real-world process:

1. **Shooting** -- The roll is loaded and actively being exposed
2. **Completed** -- All frames have been exposed; the roll is ready for processing
3. **Developed** -- The roll has been processed at a lab or in your darkroom

Swipe gestures let you quickly switch between active rolls if you carry multiple camera bodies, and the status system helps you track which rolls need to go to the lab and which are waiting to be scanned.

### CSV Export and Data Analysis

Export your complete shooting history as a CSV file with full metadata including roll name, film format, film stock, exposure data for every frame, GPS coordinates, status, dates, and personal notes. Import the data into spreadsheets or photography databases for analysis -- track which apertures you favor, how your metering accuracy improves over time, or which film stocks you use most frequently.

## 完整的胶卷管理工作流、拍摄记录和导出

每一帧胶片都是不可重复的瞬间。FilmMeter 的胶卷管理系统为你的模拟摄影工作流提供完整的数字笔记本，从装入胶卷到取回冲洗好的底片，记录每一个细节。

**创建胶卷**：选择画幅（135 或 [120 中画幅](/features/medium-format/)）、从[胶片数据库](/film-stocks/)中选择胶片型号、设置相机预设。应用根据格式自动设置帧数：135 胶卷 24 或 36 张，120 胶卷根据画幅自动计算（6x4.5 为 16 张，6x6 为 12 张，6x7 为 10 张，6x9 为 8 张）。仿 Rollei/Leica 机械计数器提供直观的帧数显示。

**逐帧记录**：每次曝光可记录光圈、快门速度、ISO、焦距、GPS 位置、参考照片、场景备注和推拉冲洗标记。[AI 场景检测](/features/scene-detection/)结果和曝光补偿值同步保存。

**状态工作流**：拍摄中 → 拍摄完成 → 已冲洗。滑动手势快速切换多个胶卷，方便同时携带多台相机的摄影师使用。

**CSV 导出**：导出完整的拍摄历史，包括胶卷名称、格式、胶片型号、每帧曝光数据、GPS 坐标和备注，用于数据分析和存档。配合[精确测光](/features/light-metering/)和[景深计算器](/features/depth-of-field/)，构建完整的胶片摄影数字工作流。
