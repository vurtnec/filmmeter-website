## Design Philosophy

> "Every element serves the photographer. Every interaction respects the craft."

FilmMeter embraces the aesthetic and principles of traditional darkroom photography. The red-black-white color scheme isn't just beautiful—it's functional, ensuring critical exposure information remains clearly visible in all lighting conditions.

The interface follows Apple's Human Interface Guidelines while incorporating the tactile, deliberate nature of film photography. Every tap, swipe, and gesture feels purposeful, just like the careful consideration that goes into every frame of film.
