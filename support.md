# FilmMeter Support

We're here to help you get the most out of FilmMeter. Whether you're experiencing technical issues, have questions about film photography techniques, or want to provide feedback, we're committed to providing excellent support.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Getting Started

**Q: What devices support FilmMeter?**
A: FilmMeter requires iOS 15.0 or later. For full functionality including LiDAR distance measurement, we recommend iPhone 12 Pro or later.

**Q: Why does FilmMeter need camera access?**
A: Camera access is essential for FilmMeter's core functionality - reading light levels to calculate proper exposure settings. All processing is done locally on your device.

**Q: Can I use FilmMeter without an internet connection?**
A: Yes! FilmMeter works completely offline. All calculations and scene detection are performed locally on your device.

### Using FilmMeter

**Q: How accurate are the exposure readings?**
A: FilmMeter uses your iPhone's sophisticated camera sensors and professional-grade algorithms optimized for film photography. Readings are calibrated for typical film characteristics.

**Q: What film stocks are supported?**
A: FilmMeter includes a comprehensive database of popular color negative and slide films, with automatic exposure compensation for each stock's characteristics.

**Q: How does the scene detection work?**
A: FilmMeter uses a hybrid approach combining histogram analysis with Apple's CoreML framework and our custom-trained machine learning model for intelligent scene recognition, all processed locally on your device.

**Q: Can I export my metering data?**
A: Yes! FilmMeter supports CSV export with full metadata including roll name, film format, stock, status, dates, and personal notes. Access this feature from the History section to analyze your shooting patterns or archive your sessions.

**Q: What film formats are supported?**
A: FilmMeter supports 135 (35mm) and 120 (medium format) film with accurate frame counters. For 120 format, we support 6x4.5, 6x6, 6x7, and 6x9 frame configurations with format-specific depth of field calculations.

**Q: What film stocks are included in the database?**
A: Our database includes popular stocks like Kodak Portra (160, 400, 800), Kodak Ektar 100, CineStill 800T, Phoenix 200, Ilford HP5+, Ilford Delta, Fuji Superia, and many more. Each stock includes tailored exposure compensation and reciprocity failure curves.

**Q: How does the reciprocity compensation work?**
A: For long exposures (typically beyond 1 second), film loses sensitivity due to reciprocity failure. FilmMeter automatically calculates the corrected exposure time based on each film stock's unique reciprocity characteristics, so you get properly exposed long-exposure shots.

### Troubleshooting

**Q: The app isn't detecting light properly**
A: Ensure your camera lens is clean and you've granted camera permissions. Try restarting the app or your device if issues persist.

**Q: LiDAR distance measurement isn't working**
A: LiDAR features are only available on iPhone 12 Pro and later models. Ensure you've granted camera and motion permissions.

**Q: My metering records aren't saving**
A: Check that you have sufficient storage space on your device. All data is stored locally and requires available storage.
